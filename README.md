## About
The main idea of this project was to create and build a single page application with enough complexity that proves my skills as a front-end developer.
The creation of the game is targeting both my apprehention of Java Script and jQuery but the intrest of all categories of players , youngsters and adults, as well.

### Why This Project?

I created this game for the Interactive Frontend Development project. 
The project scope was to create the game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the core focus being the functional logic created with JavaScript.

## UX 
Objectives of the game application: 

* Create a game that suits for all ages to improve visual memory, but focuses on children between 4-12 years old to learn colors and simple logical tasks
* Simple, intuitive and user friendly
* Player can select through 3 difficulty levels: easy mode, moderate and hard mode
* Availability of the game on all the screen sizes and all platforms
* No extra dependency, but the game itselft!

## Features
Features of this website are:
* Game starts by pressing the "Start" button
* There are two extra buttons, one for "Restart" and one to "Pause" the game at any point, which are displayed after the "Start" button has been pressed at the beginning of the game.
* When hovered over the buttons or cards cursor changes to a "pointer hand" 
* Cards display different images, back-side and when it's flipped over on the front-side
* Timer counter in seconds and minutes 
* Flipps counter as number of clicks
* Time countdown for hard mode player choice
* Multiple sounds for each functionality: background music, flipping cards,buttons victory and game over
